# Scope
In this Android app I aim to demonstrate my coding abilities, this app includes 
the management of information provided by an API and a Room database to 
sort and manage tickets.
# Description  
IMDB provides the necessary data for this app to function, I specifically pull
the movies currently on theaters and organize them inside a Recyclerview, from here
the user can purchase a ticket and set it to a specific date and hour, after which 
a specific number of tickets can be purchased (up to 50), if the user attempts to buy another 
set of tickets for the same movie the app will prompt them to delete the previous ticket.
# API key
In order to use this app an IMDB API key must be provided inside the network/API.java file, 
I have highlighted were it is supposed to go.
